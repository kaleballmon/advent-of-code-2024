# Notes on solution

## Part 1

### Assumptions
- Both lists are the same length.

### Method to solve
The way I'm planning on going about solving this is by:
1. Loading both lists and sorting them in ascending order.
1. Look at the 0th through Nth item of each item in the list
1. Take the absolute value difference of each item and add to a running sum
